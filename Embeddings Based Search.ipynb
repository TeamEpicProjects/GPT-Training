       "'Subject: \"Jack in the Box\" album by J-hope of BTS. Jack in the Box\\xa0is the debut\\xa0studio album\\xa0of South Korean rapper\\xa0J-Hope, released on July 15, 2022, through\\xa0Big Hit Music. It contains 10 tracks, including the lead single, \"More\", which preceded it on July 1, and the follow-up single, \"Arson\", which was released the same day as the album, together with an accompanying music video. A concept album revolving around the story of\\xa0Pandora\\'s box,\\xa0Jack in the Box\\xa0discusses themes of passion, ambition, humanity, insecurity, success, and anxiety about the future. Primarily an\\xa0old-school hip hop\\xa0record, the album features a blend of genres, including\\xa0pop,\\xa0grunge, and\\xa0R&B. Jack in the Box represents J-Hope\\'s \"own musical personality and vision as an artist\" and his \"aspirations to break the mold and grow further\".In an interview for Weverse Magazine published in June 2022, the rapper divulged his desire to showcase a \"different side of me...an extremely dark, raw side\" in his current projects, in contrast to the \"sunny demeanor\" he often displays. He further elaborated that he \"wanted to show I have things I want to say, but I kept feeling like, if I did them in the same style I always have, they wouldn\\'t come across well. If I was going to convey the things I wanted to say, I would have to be darker. It\\'s something I’ve never done before, so I was excited to try something new. I was heavily influenced by what my heart was telling me, and that\\'s why I decided to give it a try. A concept album based on the Greek tale of Pandora\\'s box, Jack in the Box opens with \"Intro\", a female-narrated reading of the story from which J-Hope\\'s stagename is derived. The existential \"Pandora\\'s Box\", about the rapper\\'s life as an idol, follows next. In it, he speaks about \"serving others over himself\"—the song\\'s lyrics, \"Someone\\'s light, someone\\'s smile/ Someone\\'s hope, my activities are someone\\'s life\", \"highlight the weight of his responsibility to his fans\"—and questions his own perspectives. The third track \"More\" is about J-Hope\\'s \"passion, bold ambition, and greed\" to \"show the world how much he has grown\", taking risks, and \"a certain vital recklessness.\" A 90s-inspired, \"swag-filled\" song with a \"grungy rock \\'n roll vibe\" that features a \"darker, edgier sound\" in comparison to his previous releases, the track is a fusion of old-school hip hop and arena/alt-rock. It showcases the rapper\\'s \"unique rhythmic flow\" and utilizes \"scream-singing\". The tenth track \"Arson\", is an introspective about him \"encountering \\'the world outside the box\" while stuck at a crossroads and deciding which path to take next. Described in a press release as one of the main songs—together with \"More\"—that conveys the core message of Jack in the Box, it serves as the album\\'s closing track. Number of tracks: 10. List of song names in the album: Intro, Pandora\\'s Box, More, Stop, Equal Sign, Music Box: Reflection, Safety Zone, What if, Future, Arson. Languages: English, Korean.'"
